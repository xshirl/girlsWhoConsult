          <p className="quote">GWC has provided me with a community of like-minded girls that understand
            each other's professional struggles, but also celebrate each other's success. Without the
            knowledge I have gained from GWC I would have no idea  how to network or break into the
            industry. Due to what I learned, I've been able to get an interview with a boutique firm.

          <p className="quote">GWC has been an incredible community full of knowledgeable and empowering
            ladies who are so willing to help each other. I had no idea what consulting
            was before GWC. I just knew I was interested in it. Even though I was a senior,
            I was welcomed with open arms and all my questions were answered without any
            judgment. GWC has given me the confidence, skills, and knowledge I needed to go
            through recruitment.

          <p className="quote">The GWC Training Program was a great way to find a community of women that
            wanted to help each other further our careers! I felt super supported and I loved
            getting my questions answered and resume/cover letters edited by actual consultants
            in the field. It helped me land a consulting internship offer at Baker Tilly for the summer
            and I couldn't be more excited!
